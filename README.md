A simple image format converter script

How to use:
In your terminal step to this files location and enter: python JPG_PNGconverter.py [input folder directory] [output folder directory]

The script will then ask if you would like to pick a format or to use the default(.png).

Once you've decided, the script will start converting, and your new images will be in your desired folder.
